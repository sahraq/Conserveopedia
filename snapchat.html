            <h2>Privacy Violations and Data Harvesting by Snapchat</h2>
            <p>Snapchat has been involved in several data privacy issues, including unauthorized collection of user data and breaches that exposed private information. Below are the key privacy violations associated with the platform:</p>

            <h3>Data Harvesting Practices</h3>
            <p>Snapchat collects a vast amount of user data, much of it potentially used for targeted advertising. This includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Location Tracking:</strong> Snapchat tracks user location through Geofilters and Snap Map. Despite offering an option to turn off location tracking, users' IP addresses can still reveal their approximate location, enabling tracking.</li>
                <li><strong>Facial Recognition:</strong> Snapchat uses facial recognition technology in its filters and lenses, raising concerns about the storage and usage of biometric data. The data can be shared with third parties for ad targeting without explicit user consent.</li>
                <li><strong>Behavioral Data:</strong> Snapchat collects data on user behavior such as time spent on the app, interactions with other users, and engagement with specific features (e.g., Stories, Lenses). This information is used to tailor advertisements to users.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Past Data Breaches and Privacy Violations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>2014 Data Breach:</strong> Snapchat suffered a major data breach in 2014 when hackers accessed over 4.6 million user account details. Although the breach was partly due to weak security protocols, it raised serious concerns about how user data was being protected.</li>
                <li><strong>2019 Data Harvesting Allegations:</strong> In 2019, it was reported that Snapchat had been collecting users’ phone numbers and email addresses without proper disclosure or user consent, especially via its app integrations with other platforms.</li>
                <li><strong>Unclear Privacy Policies:</strong> Snapchat’s privacy policies have been criticized for being overly vague, leaving users uncertain about how their personal data is being collected, shared, and stored.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Ongoing Privacy Concerns</h3>
            <p>Despite several improvements to its security features, Snapchat continues to face scrutiny over its data handling practices, particularly its collection of location, biometric, and behavioral data. The platform has been criticized for its minimal transparency and lack of clear user consent protocols.</p>
