            <h2>Privacy Violations and Data Harvesting by TikTok</h2>
            <p>TikTok, a popular social media platform, has faced significant criticism over its data collection practices and privacy violations. Below are key incidents that have raised concerns about user privacy:</p>

            <h3>Data Harvesting Practices</h3>
            <p>TikTok collects a wide range of personal data from users, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Location Tracking:</strong> TikTok tracks users' locations through GPS data, IP addresses, and device sensors. The app gathers location data even when the app is not actively being used, posing risks for unauthorized tracking.</li>
                <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> TikTok collects detailed device information, such as device model, operating system, network information, and mobile carrier. This data helps improve app functionality but raises privacy concerns.</li>
                <li><strong>User Behavior:</strong> TikTok gathers data on user interactions, such as the videos watched, the time spent on the app, and engagement with specific content. This is used to personalize recommendations and advertisements but can also create a detailed user profile for targeted marketing.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Past Data Breaches and Privacy Violations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>2019 Security Flaw:</strong> TikTok was found to have a security vulnerability that allowed third-party apps to access user data without consent. This included unauthorized access to private videos and user profiles, compromising the privacy of millions of users.</li>
                <li><strong>2019 Lawsuit Over Data Harvesting:</strong> The platform was sued for allegedly violating U.S. childrenâ€™s privacy laws (COPPA) by collecting personal data from minors without proper consent. TikTok agreed to a $5.7 million settlement.</li>
                <li><strong>2020 U.S. Government Concerns:</strong> In 2020, the U.S. government raised national security concerns over TikTok's data handling, citing its links to China and the potential for data sharing with the Chinese government. Although TikTok denied these claims, the app faced increasing scrutiny.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Ongoing Privacy Concerns</h3>
            <p>Despite ongoing security updates and attempts to address privacy violations, TikTok still faces accusations of mishandling user data. Privacy advocates have criticized the app for its opaque data practices and the risks posed by its integration with other companies that may use the data for advertising or surveillance purposes.</p>
